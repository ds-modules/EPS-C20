Besides, we can show the blind zone (places not getting alert) as a red circle. We can calculate the alert time based on 3 different models ((1) iasp91, (2) ak135, (3) common, and also the alert time. The common model is just simply assume the P wave velocity as 6.1 km/s and the S wave speed as 3.55 km/s. Cities are stored as dictionary, see the above section for the explain. \n",
